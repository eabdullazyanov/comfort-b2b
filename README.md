# comfort-b2b

A Yarn 4 (Berry) TypeScript monorepo: a **shared zod-schema package** is the
single source of truth for all data crossing the wire, consumed by a **mock
Express backend** (which randomly returns typed errors) and a **React Native
CLI app** (MobX + react-native-paper + i18n EN/RU) that shops a 1000-item
catalog and confirms orders with a 1000 ₽ minimum.

Data flow: `shared` schemas → `backend` routes (validated before send) and
`mobile` api client (validated on receive) → HTTP between them.

## Prerequisites

- **Node 22+** (`.nvmrc` pins 22; run `nvm use`).
- **Yarn 4** via Corepack — `corepack enable` (the repo pins `yarn@4.9.1`).
- For the **mobile native builds** only:
  - Android: Android Studio + SDK + an emulator/device.
  - iOS (macOS): Xcode, plus Ruby/Bundler + CocoaPods (`gem install bundler`).

## Install & verify

```bash
corepack enable
yarn install
yarn check   # typecheck → lint → knip → test → format:check (must be all green)
```

`yarn check` is the canonical "is everything OK" command and is what the Husky
`pre-commit` hook runs. Individual scripts also exist: `yarn typecheck`,
`yarn lint`, `yarn knip`, `yarn test`, `yarn format` / `yarn format:check`.

## Running the app

The backend and the app run as separate processes:

```bash
# backend (watch mode)
yarn workspace @comfort-b2b/backend dev

# iOS (macOS): install CocoaPods once, then build + launch
yarn pods
yarn workspace @comfort-b2b/mobile ios

# Android: build + launch on a running emulator/device
yarn workspace @comfort-b2b/mobile android
```

`react-native run-ios`/`run-android` start Metro automatically; run it on its own
with `yarn start` if you prefer.

**Reaching the backend from a device/emulator:** the host's `localhost` is
`http://10.0.2.2:3000` from the Android emulator and `http://localhost:3000`
from the iOS simulator. (The typed runtime config that selects this lands in
Phase 5 via `react-native-config`.)

## Backend API

The backend listens on `http://localhost:3000` by default and exposes:

| Method & path     | Purpose                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET /catalog`    | 1000 generated products (zod-validated before send) |
| `POST /analytics` | accepts an `AnalyticsEvent`, returns `{ ok: true }` |
| `POST /orders`    | accepts an `OrderPayload`, returns `{ orderId }`    |

### Configuration & triggering the simulated errors

**Backend configuration is entirely optional** — the server starts with sane
defaults and zero env vars. To customize, copy `packages/backend/.env.example` →
`packages/backend/.env` and tweak (each var is optional and parsed/validated
with zod at boot):

| Variable                 | Effect / how to trigger an error                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                   | Server port (default `3000`).                                                                             |
| `ANALYTICS_FAILURE_RATE` | Probability `[0–1]` that `POST /analytics` returns **503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE**. Set `1` to always fail.   |
| `ORDER_FAILURE_RATE`     | Probability `[0–1]` that `POST /orders` returns **503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE** (after deterministic checks). |
| `LATENCY_MS`             | Artificial latency added to every response.                                                               |
| `SEED`                   | Integer seed → deterministic catalog + failures (for reproducible testing).                               |

Deterministic errors (no env needed):

- **422 MIN_AMOUNT_NOT_REACHED** — send an order with `total < 1000`.
- **409 INSUFFICIENT_STOCK** — order a line whose `qty` exceeds the product's `stock`.
- **400 VALIDATION_ERROR** — send a body that fails the zod schema.

## Architecture rationale

- **zod as the single source of truth** (`@comfort-b2b/shared/schemas`): every
  boundary object is a zod schema paired with its `z.infer` type. The value and
  the type share one identifier, so backend and app can't drift.
- **Validate at every boundary**: the backend validates request bodies and
  re-parses responses before sending. The app re-parses every response with
  `safeParse` and maps error envelopes to a discriminated union keyed by `code`.
  On a success-shape mismatch the app is **resilient, not fatal** — it surfaces
  the validation error but still passes the payload through rather than throwing.
- **Seedable faults**: the backend's randomness is a seedable RNG, so each error
  branch is forceable in tests and reproducible by setting `SEED`.
- **MobX stores** (app) keep business logic out of components; an analytics
  delivery queue fires on every cart change with retry/backoff.

## Conventions

Coding conventions (no-`as`, one-util-per-file, no barrels, import/order,
Prettier, the RN CommonJS exceptions, etc.) are defined and enforced in
`.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — that's the single source of truth, not this README.
